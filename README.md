# ClockIn-ClockOut

A budget friendly app that could be used to clock-in when you arrive at work and clock-out when you leave from work.

---

## How to use

1. Open the app
2. Enter your employee ID
3. Choose either **IN** to *clock-in* or **out** to *clock-out*
4. A QR code will be shown containing your employee ID, the current time and what you chose on step `3`

`Note:` the QR code will change every minute to prevent any employee from cheating with their arrival time :)

### Scanner mode

To scan employees clocking QR codes, enter the scanner ID `100100` and tap any of the buttons to open up the scanner.

### How to access the data
The entries will be saved inside the local storage in a csv file. Open your file manager and go to the app's folder. The file will be there.
